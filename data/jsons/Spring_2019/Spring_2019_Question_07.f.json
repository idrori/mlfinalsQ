       "Question": "In this problem, we consider using linear regression with a regularization term. Assume a datnset of $n$ samples $\\left\\{\\left(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}\\right)\\right\\}$ with $x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and output values $y^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Recall that the ridge regression objective is deflned as follows:\n$$\nJ_{\\text {ridge }}(\\theta)=J_{\\text {data }}(\\theta)+J_{\\text {reg }}(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\theta^{T} x^{(i)}-y^{(i)}\\right)^{2}+\\left.\\lambda|| \\theta\\right|^{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\theta=\\left[\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}\\right]$ and $\\lambda$ is the regularization trude-off parameter.\nChris would like to solve the problem of computing $\\theta$ that minimizes the ridge regression objective. He will exnploy graphical methods to obtrin the solution. When plotting just the data error term, $J_{\\text {data }}(\\theta)$, as a function of $\\theta_{1}$ and $\\theta_{2}$, the following set of isocontour lines (curves connecting sets of $\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}$ for which the objective value is constant) is obtained, for his dataset:\nWhat is the effect of the regularization trade-off parameter $\\lambda$ on the shape and value of the isocontour lines of the regularization term $J_{\\text {reg }}(\\theta)$ ?",
       "Solution": "The shape remains concentric circles centered at the origin. $\\lambda$ scales the isocontour value for each radius of these concentric circles. (Note that for a constant isocontour value, the radius then decreases.) Visualizing the shape as a bowl, larger $\\lambda$ makes the bowl steeper."
