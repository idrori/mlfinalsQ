       "Question": "Consider the following 2D dataset in (x,y) format: ((1,-1), +1), ((1,1),  +1), ((1,2.5),+1), ((2,-2),-1), ((2,1),+1),((2,3),+1),((5,-1),-1),((5,-2),-1). Break ties in distance by choosing the point with smaller x_1 coordinate, and if still tied, by smaller x_2 coordinate.\nCompute the leave-one-out cross validation accuracy of the 3-nearest-neighbor learning algorithm on this dataset.",
       "Solution": "7/8. Now only the point at (2,-2) will be misclassi\fed during testing, when left out of the training set."
