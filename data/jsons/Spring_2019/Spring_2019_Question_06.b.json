       "Question": "After taking 6.036, Bob decides to train a recommender system to predict what ratings different customers will give to different movies. Currently, he knows of three really popular movies, and he knows of two potential customers who have ranked some of these movies. The data matrix currently looks like: $Y=[[2, ?, 3],[4,2, ?]]$ where, as in class, rows correspond to customers and columns correspond to movies, and ? indicates a missing or unknown ranking. He decides to find a low rank factorization of $Y$ using the alternating least squares algorithm implemented in class. Assume for this question that offsets are set to $0.$\nWhat is the optimal value of $V$?",
       "Solution": "The optimal value is $V=[2,1,3]^{T}$. We are fortunate in being able to exactly match all of the non-empty $Y$ elements."
