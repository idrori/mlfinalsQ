       "Question": "Network A is a neural network with a single convolution of size 3. It has a single max pooling layer with size d so the output of the network it sigmoid (max(z1,..zd)). Network B is a neural network with a single convolution of size 3. It has a single min pooling layer with size d so the output of the network it sigmoid (min(z1,..zd)). For which network does a high output value correspond, qualitatively, to \u201cat least half of the locations in x correspond to an instance of the desired pattern\u201d choose between A or B or none.",
       "Solution": "None"
