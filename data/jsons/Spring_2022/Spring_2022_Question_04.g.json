       "Question": "We're given a data set $D=\\left\\{\\left(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}\\right)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, where $x^{(i)} \\in R^{d}$ and $y^{(i)} \\in R$. Let $X$ be a $d \\times n$ matrix in which the $x^{(i)}$ are the columns and let $Y$ be a $1 \\times n$ vector containing the values of $y^{(i)}$. Using the analytical regression (ordinary least-squares) formula, we can compute\n $$\n W_{o l s}=\\left(X X^{T}\\right)^{-1} X Y^{T}\n $$\n Using ridge regression, we can compute\n $$\n W_{\\text {ridge }}=\\left(X X^{T}+\\lambda I\\right)^{-1} X Y^{T}\n $$\n We decide to try to use these methods to initialize a single-unit 'neural network' with a linear activation function and no offset:\n $$\n h(x ; W)=W^{T} x .\n $$\n Assume that $X X^{T}$ is invertible and not equal to the identity matrix, and that neither $W_{o l s}$ nor $W_{\\text {ridge }}$ is equal to $(0,0, \\ldots, 0)$. Note also that we are not using an explicit offset/bias term. \nProvide a data set with 3 points for which the original OLS hypothesis class can reach a substantially lower MSE than Ryo's hypothesis class or argue that one does not exist.",
       "Solution": "Does not exist: You can stretch out the sigmoid so that the linear part of it is pretty linear and goes wherever you want it to."
