       "Question": "Network A is a neural network with a single convolution of size 3. It has a single max pooling layer with size d so the output of the network it sigmoid (max(z1,..zd)). Network B is a neural network with a single convolution of size 3. It has a single min pooling layer with size d so the output of the network it sigmoid (min(z1,..zd)). What is $\\partial g / \\partial z_{i}$ for network A? Feel free to make use of the fact that $\\partial \\sigma(z) / \\partial z=\\sigma(z)(1-\\sigma(z))$.",
       "Solution": "$\\sigma\\left(z_{i}\\right)\\left(1-\\sigma\\left(z_{i}\\right)\\right)$ if $z_{i}=\\max \\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{d}\\right)$, and 0 otherwise."
