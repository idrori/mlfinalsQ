       "Question": "Consider the simplest of all neural networks, consisting of a single unit with a sigmoid activation function: $h(x;w = \\sigma(w_0 + w_1x)$ where $\\sigma(z) = (1 + exp(-z))^{-1}$ Let\u2019s start with a classifier defined by $w_0 = 0$ and $w_1 = 1$. Which range of input values x are classified as positive? Which as negative?",
       "Solution": "Positive if x > 0; negative otherwise."
