       "Points": 1.0,
       "Topic": "Clustering",
       "Type": "Image",
       "Question": "Assume that the number of clusters $k=2$ for all of the following questions. \nJust as in (a), walk through each step of the $k$-means algorithm, beginning with the initialization shown in the plot in the top left. In each plot (go left to right, top to down), mark with two ' $x$ ' symbols where the cluster centers are in that iteration of $k$-means. Once the $k$-means algorithm has converged, you can leave all subsequent figures unmarked.",
       "Solution": "Image filling"
