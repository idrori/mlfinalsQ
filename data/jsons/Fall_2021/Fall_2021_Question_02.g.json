       "Question": "Assume that the number of clusters k = 2. Christy thinks she came up with a compelling new initialization method for the $k$-means algorithm. Looking at her code below, explain why it is unlikely to give good results.\n\\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]\ndef kmeans_init(X, n_clusters):\n    centers = []\n    for i in range(n_clusters):\n        centers.append(X[:, X.shape[1]-1-i])\n    return np.asarray(centers).T\n\\end{lstlisting}",
       "Solution": "Christy's method selects the last n\\_clusters data points as the cluster centers. These points may be very close to each other, leading to the $k$-means algorithm finding a poor local optima of the $k$-means objective."
