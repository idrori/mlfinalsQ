       "Topic": "CNNs",
       "Type": "Image",
       "Question": "MIT grad student Rec Urrent would like to submit an entry to win this year's Grand ML Tetris Competition, which gives awards to the smallest neural networks which can identify tetris pieces with the highest accuracy. Rec seeks to make a convolutional neural network that can accurately classify single-channel $3 \\times 3$ images of $2 \\mathrm{D}$ tetris pieces as being either a line-shaped piece, or a corner-shaped piece, using just one $2 \\times 2$ filter. Let's help Rec win this competition. \n Rec writes a bit of python code to implement their tiny CNN classifier for images of 2D tetris pieces, following examples they have seen in $6.036$. They include in the comments the dimensions of the numpy arrays, where known.\n\nFor performing binary classification, what activation function should Rec use for $f$ inal_act and which loss function should Rec use?",
       "Solution": "Sigmoid + Negative Log Likelihood Loss\n"
