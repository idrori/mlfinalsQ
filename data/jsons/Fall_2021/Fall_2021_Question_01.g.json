       "Question": "Mac O\u2019Larnin is considering selling an app on Frugal Play. You have a friend with inside info at Frugal, and they\u2019re able to share data on how previous apps have performed on the store. Mac decides that he will learn a neural network with no hidden layer (i.e., consisting only of the output layer). He needs help in figuring out the precise formulation for machine learning.\nWhen Mac wakes up the next day, he decides to re-run learning using \u03bb = 100, now with a different partition of the data into train and validation sets (since he had previously forgotten to set the random seed). He finds that he gets a very different validation error! To obtain a more stable estimate, Mac decides to split the data into 5 disjoint chunks of 20% of the data. For each chunk, he evaluates on it after training on the union of the other 4 chunks. He gets the following results for the average error within each chunk: 0.15, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25. What can Mac conclude is an estimate of the test error of the neural network?",
       "Solution": "0.2 (the average). This is cross-validation."
