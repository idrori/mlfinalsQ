       "Question Number": "1",
       "Part": "i",
       "Points": 1.0,
       "Topic": "Neural Networks",
       "Type": "Image",
       "Question": "Based on these plots does it seem likely that even more data will improve validation error (possibly for a different value of $\\lambda$ )? Explain why or why not.",
       "Solution": "Yes, because the validation error continues to decline as the amount of regularization decreases and amount of data increases. With more data and $\\lambda=0$, it is conceivable that the validation error will be even smaller."
