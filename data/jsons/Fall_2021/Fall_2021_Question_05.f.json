       "Question": "Ena can be in one of three states: fit, partially fit, or injured. Ena can choose 3 actions: play, train or break. The discount factor is 1. When Ena is fully fit and decides to play the reward is +100. When Ena is fully fit and decides to trainthe reward is -10. When Ena is fully fit and decides to break there is no reward. When Ena is partially fit and decides to play the reward is +20. When Ena is partially fit and decides to train the reward is -10. When Ena is partially fit and decides to break the reward is -20.  When Ena is injured and decides to play the reward is -60. When Ena is injured and decides to train the reward is -30. When Ena is injured and decides to break the reward is 0. When Ena is fully fit and decides to play there is an 80% chance of remaining fully fit and 20% chance of getting injured. When Ena is fully fit and decides to train there is an 90% chance of remaining fully fit and a 10% chance of getting injured. When Ena is fully fit and decides to break there is an 50% chance of remaining fully fit and 50% chance of being partially fit. When Ena is partially fit and decided to play there is a 50% chance of remaining partially fit and 50% chance of getting injured. When Ena is partially fit and decided to train there is a 40% chance of remaining partially fit and 60% chance of getting fully fit. When Ena is partially fit and decided to break there is a 100% chance of remaining partially fit. When Ena is injured and decides to play there is a 100% chance of remaining injured. When Ena is injured and decides to train there is a 100% chance of reamining injured. When Ena is injured and decides to break there is a 50% chance of remaining injured and 50% chance of being partially fit. \nDjo Ko is another athlete who plays the same sport. Djo Ko has the exact same MDP\nas Ena\u2019s, except Djo\u2019s team has forgotten the reward for playing when in the fully fit state. Djo\u2019s team also remember that the horizon 2 best action to take in the\npartially fit state is exactly the same as that for Ser Ena (determined in part b). Given this information, what are the range of possible values for R(fully fit, play) for Djo Ko? Assume discount of 1.",
       "Solution": "R(fully fit, play) > 32\u221710/6 = 53.33."
