       "Topic": "Clustering",
       "Type": "Image",
       "Question": "Assume that the number of clusters $k=2$ for all of the following questions. \nEach of the following five data sets has two ground truth clusters, whose points are denoted as '\u5341' and ' $o$ '. For which of these would the clustering with the smallest $k$-means objective value not recover the ground truth? Assurne $k=2$. (Select all that apply.)",
       "Solution": " $\\mathrm{O}$ (I) $\\sqrt{\\text { (II) } \\quad \\sqrt{(\\mathrm{II})} \\sqrt{(\\mathrm{IV})} \\sqrt{(\\mathrm{V})}$\n(I)\n(II)\n(III)\n(IV)\n$(\\mathrm{V})$"
