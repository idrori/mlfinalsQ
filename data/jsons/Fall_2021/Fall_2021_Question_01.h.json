       "Type": "Image",
       "Question": "The initial results look promising. Mac now wants to add in data from additional, earlier, years. (He is confident his customers have been behaving similarly over many years, so the earlier data is relevant.)\n\nBefore curating the older data, Mac decides to use the training data that he has to get a sense of whether more data would help. He creates a learning curve where on the horizontal axis he varies the amount of training data used and on the vertical axis he shows the validation error, using a fixed validation set across all settings considered. He experiments with $\\lambda=1,10,100$, but again forgot to include a legend. Fill in the below legend by labeling the curves with the value of $\\lambda$ that each corresponds to:",
       "Solution": "Image filling"
