       "Points": 2.0,
       "Topic": "Neural Networks",
       "Type": "Image",
       "Question": "Consider just the general shape of the following plots. For each of the following possible interpretations of the quantities being plotted on the $\\mathrm{X}$ and $Y$ axes, indicate which of the plots would most typically be the result, or mark \"none\" if none are appropriate.\n\nAssume all quantities other than $\\mathrm{X}$ are held constant during the experiment. Error quantities reported are averages over the data set they are being reported on.\nProvide a one-sentence justification for each answer.\n\nX axis: Order of polynomial feature set $\\mathbf{Y}$ axis: training set error\n$\\sqrt{A} \\bigcirc \\mathrm{B} \\bigcirc \\mathrm{C} \\bigcirc \\mathrm{D} \\bigcirc$ none",
       "Solution": "A.\nMore features makes it easier to fit complex data."
