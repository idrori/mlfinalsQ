       "Question": "Here is a dataset in the form of (x, y) coordinates. P1 = (1, 1), P2 = (6, 6), P3 = (4, 6), P4 = (6, 4) and the seperator is a line at y = 3.5. Let our objective be the regularized average hinge loss with respect to $\\gamma_{\\text {ref }}$ :\n$$\nJ\\left(\\theta, \\theta_{0}, \\gamma_{\\text {ref }}\\right)=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} L_{H}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma\\left(x, y, \\theta, \\theta_{0}\\right)}{\\gamma_{\\text {ref }}}\\right)+\\lambda \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{\\text {ref }}^{2}}\n$$\nNow let $\\lambda=\\epsilon$, a very small value, and consider that same separator. What value of $\\gamma_{\\text {ref }}$ achieves the closest to optimal value of $J$? Choose from the following list (-10, -1, -.5, 0, .5, 1, 10)",
