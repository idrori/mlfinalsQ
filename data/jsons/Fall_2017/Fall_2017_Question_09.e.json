       "Question": "Here is a dataset in the form of (x, y) coordinates. P1 = (1, 1), P2 = (6, 6), P3 = (4, 6), P4 = (6, 4) and the seperator is a line at y = 3.5. Let our objective be the regularized average hinge loss with respect to $\\gamma_{\\text {ref }}$ :\n$$\nJ\\left(\\theta, \\theta_{0}, \\gamma_{\\text {ref }}\\right)=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} L_{H}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma\\left(x, y, \\theta, \\theta_{0}\\right)}{\\gamma_{\\text {ref }}}\\right)+\\lambda \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{\\text {ref }}^{2}}\n$$\nWhy might we prefer a maximum-margin separator over the one originally provided?",
       "Solution": "We expect it will generalize better because it is not as dependent on the data points (a small variation in the data probably won't change the result too much)."
