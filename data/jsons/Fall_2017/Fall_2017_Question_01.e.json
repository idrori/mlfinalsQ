       "Question": "We're given a data set $D=\\left\\{\\left(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}\\right)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, where $x^{(i)} \\in R^{d}$ and $y^{(i)} \\in R$. Let $X$ be a $d \\times n$ matrix in which the $x^{(i)}$ are the columns and let $Y$ be a $1 \\times n$ vector containing the values of $y^{(i)}$. Using the ordinary least-squares formula, we can compute $$ W_{o l s}=\\left(X X^{T}\\right)^{-1} X Y^{T} $$ Using ridge regression, we can compute $$ W_{\\text {ridge }}=\\left(X X^{T}+\\lambda I\\right)^{-1} X Y^{T} $$ We decide to try to use these methods to initialize a single-unit \"neural network\" with a linear activation function. Assume that $X X^{T}$ is neither singular nor equal to the identity matrix, and that neither $W_{\\text {ols }}$ nor $W_{\\text {ridge }}$ is equal to $(0,0, \\ldots, 0)$. Consider a neuron initialized with $W_{\\text {ridge. Provide an objective function }} J(W)$ that depends on the data, such that batch gradient descent to minimize $J$ will have no effect on the weights, or argue that one does not exist.",
       "Solution": "$J(W)=\\left(W^{T} X-Y\\right)^{2}+\\lambda\\|W\\|^{2}$"
