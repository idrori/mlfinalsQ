       "Question": "We generated a data set with 5 data-points, with $x$ and $y$ values in $\\mathbb{R}$ and applied several regression methods to it.\n\nFor each figure below, specify (a) which regression methods could possibly have generated the hypothesis on some data set and (b) given that each hypothesis was actually generated by exactly one of these methods, match each hypothesis to a single method.\nA 1-Nearest neighbor\nB Regression tree (with constants in the leaves)\nC Regression tree (with linear regressors in the leaves)\nD Linear regression with no feature transformation\nE Linear regression with second-order polynomial features\n$\\mathrm{F}$ Linear regression with fifth-order polynomial features\n$\\mathrm{G}$ Neural network with no hidden layer and sigmoid output non-linearity\nH Neural network with one ReLU hidden layer and no output non-linearity",
       "Solution": "Image matching"
