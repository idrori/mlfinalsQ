       "Topic": "Decision Trees",
       "Type": "Text",
       "Question": "There are different strategies for pruning decision trees. We assume that we grow \na decision tree until there is one or a small number of elements in each leaf. Then, we \nprune by deleting individual leaves of the tree until the score of the tree starts to get worse.\nThe question is how to score each possible pruning of the tree.\n Here is a definition of the score: The score is the percentage correct of the tree on a separate validation set. Explain whether or not it would be a good \nidea and give a reason why or why not.",
       "Solution": "A good idea. The validation set will be an independent check on whether pruning a node is likely to increase or decrease performance on unseen data."
