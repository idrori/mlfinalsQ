       "Question": "We can do machine learning experiments in which we hold all parameters constant, vary a single parameter, take the hypotheses we have learned at each point, and plot its error on the training and test sets. For each experiment below, select a plot from above that indicates the generally expected shape of the curve for training and for test error. If the experiment doesn't make any sense, choose \"not sensible\" rather than a curve above.\n\nDon't worry about the fact that we would generally expect curves to bounce around a bit and not be as smooth as these. Also, don't necessarily interpret the plotted $x$ axis as being for the value $y=0$.\nProvide a one-sentence justification for each answer. \nX axis: gradient-descent step size $\\eta$\ntrain error:\ntest error:",
       "Solution": "train error: C\nSmall step size is slow to converge; big step size may diverge,\ntest error: $\\mathrm{C}$\nTest error is likely to suffer in the same way as training error."
