       "Question": "Consider the following MDP with $k+4$ statess. There are two actions, $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$. Arrows with no labels represent a transition for both actions with probability 1. Arrows labeled $a / p$ make the transition on action $a$ with probability $p$. States with no label have reward 0 . Two states have reward $+1$, obtained when taking an action in that state. There are $k-2$ states between $s_{1}$ and $s_{k}$, with a deterministic transition on any action (so that once you are in s1 you are guaranteed to end up in $s_{k}$ in $k-1$ steps).\nWe are interested in the infinite-horizon discounted values of some states in this MDP. What is $V\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ as a function of $k$ when $\\gamma=0$ ?",
       "Solution": "0"
