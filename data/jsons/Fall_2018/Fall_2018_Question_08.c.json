       "Type": "Text",
       "Question": "There are different strategies for pruning decision trees. We assume that we grow \na decision tree until there is one or a small number of elements in each leaf. Then, we \nprune by deleting individual leaves of the tree until the score of the tree starts to get worse.\nThe question is how to score each possible pruning of the tree.\n Here is a definition of the score: The score is the percentage correct of the tree, computed using cross validation. Explain whether or not it would be a good idea and give a reason why or why not.",
       "Solution": "Not a good idea. Cross-validation allows you to evaluate algorithms, not individual\nhypotheses. Cross-validation will construct many new hypotheses and average their\nperformance, this will not tell you whether pruning a node in a particular hypothesis is\nworthwhile or not."
