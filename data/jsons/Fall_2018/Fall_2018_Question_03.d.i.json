       "Question": "Dana has an idea for a new kind of network called a ModConv NN. If the network is n\u21e5n, we will use a filter of size n/k (assume k evenly divides n). To compute entry (a, b) of the resulting image, we apply this filter to the \u201csubimage\u201d of pixels (i, j) from the original image, where i mod k = a and j mod k = b. Could we train the weights of a ModConvNN using gradient descent? Explain why or why not.",
       "Solution": "Sure. Just another parametric model"
