       "Question": "It is common in classification problems for the cost of a false positive (predicting positive when the true answer is negative) to be different from the cost of a false negative (predicting negative when the true answer is positive). This might happen, for example, when the task is to predict the presence of a serious disease.\nLet\u2019s say that the cost of a correct classification is 0, the cost of a false positive is 1, and the\ncost of a false negative (that is, you predict 0 when the correct answer was +1) is \u03b1. Recall that the usual logistic regression loss is: \\begin{equation*} \n\\mathcal{L}_\\text{nll}(g, y) = \n-\\left(y \\cdot \\log g + (1 - y)\\cdot\\log (1 -\n g)\\right) \\;\\;.\n\\end{equation*}\nUsually, in logistic regression, we predict class +1 when a > 0.5 and -1 otherwise. Jin proposes that we can use the standard logistic regression loss function and the same data set, but change the threshold of 0.5 that we use to select a prediction. Would you increase or decrease the threshold when \u03b1 = 3? ",
       "Solution": "decrease"
