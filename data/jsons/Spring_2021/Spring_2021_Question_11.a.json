       "Question": "Ronnie makes a simple RNN with state dimension 1 and a {\\em step} function for $f_1$, so that  \\[s_t = \\text{step}( w_1 x_t + w_2 s_{t-1} + b) \\] where $\\text{step}(z) = 1$ if $z > 0.0$ and equals $0$ otherwise, and where the output  \\[y_t = s_t\\,\\,.\\]. Assuming $s_0 = 0$, what values of $w_1$, $w_2$ and $b$ would generate output sequence  \\[[0, 0, 0,  1, 1, 1, 1]\\] given input sequence \\[ [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\\] ",
       "Solution": "Since xt = 1 and st = 0 produces st = 1, we have that w1 + b > 0, for example w1 = 1 if b = 0\nSince xt = 0 and st = 1 produces st = 1, we have that w2 + b > 0, for example w2 = 1 if b = 0\nSince xt = 0 and st = 0 produces st = 0, we have that b \u2264 0."
