       "Question": "Sam wants to build a neural network that takes in a scalar value $x$ in the range $[0,1]$ and generates a one-hot output vector $y$ of dimension $K$, where, for $k \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, K-1\\}$, $y k=1$ if and only if $k / K<x \\leq(k+1) / K$; that is, it discretizes the interval into $K$ equally sized sequential ranges. Plesse don't worry about precisely what the output is at the boundaries of the intervals.\n\nThey choose an architecture with a single linear layer with weights $W$ and $W_{0}$ and a softmax activation function, so that the output\n$$\na=\\operatorname{softmax}(z)\n$$\nwhere\n$$\nz=W^{T} x+W_{0}\n$$\nAssume that, for prediction purposes, we are going to take the output of the network, $a$, and convert it into a $K$-dimensional one-hot vector $\\left(y_{0}, \\ldots, y_{k-1}\\right)$ where\n$$\ny_{i}= \\begin{cases}1 & \\text { if } i=\\arg \\max _{j} a_{j} \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\nThat is, it has a value of 1 at the index corresponding to the maximal element of $a$ and value 0 everywhere else. \nLet's consider the case of $K=3$. On the axes below, draw the three components of the $z$ vector, $z_{0}, z_{1}$, and $z_{2}$, as a function of $x$ so that the resulting $y$ will provide a correct discretization of the interval into three equal regions. (There are many correct solutions.)",
