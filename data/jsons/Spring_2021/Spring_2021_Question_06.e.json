       "Question": "PairNet definition: The PairNet is parameterized by (a) the weights $W$ of a small network $\\textrm{NN}$ and (b) one more scalar $w_0$. If there are a total of $d$ features in the input, it has the final form of:\n\\[y = \\sigma(w_0 + \\sum_{j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, d\\}, k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, d\\}, j \\neq k} \\textrm{NN}([x_j, x_k]; W))\\]\nThe small neural network, parameterized by weights $W$, takes a two-dimensional vector as input and generates a scalar output.   We write it as $\\text{NN}([x_i, x_j]; W)$.   If this smaller neural network has multiple layers, then $W$ includes all the weights of all the layers, including offsets.  We apply PairNet to an image by letting $x_i$ and $x_j$ be pairs of pixel values drawn from throughout the input image, and $d$ is the total number of pixels.\nHairNet definition:  A hairnet has hairy layers and max pooling layers.  A hairy layer is a lot like a convolutional layer, but it uses a different set of weights on each image patch.\nDefine the local 3 x 3 region of the (zero-padded) input image $I$ around pixel $i, j$:\n    \\begin{align*}\n    R(I,i,j) = (&I_{i-1, j-1}, I_{i-1, j}, I_{i-1, j+1}, \\\\\n                 &I_{i, j-1}, I_{i, j}, I_{i, j+1}, \\\\\n                 &I_{i+1, j-1}, I_{i+1, j}, I_{i+1, j+1})\n    \\end{align*}\nwhere $I_{i,j}$ is the pixel $i, j$ of $I$.\nPixel $i,j$ of the output image is computed as the dot product of $R(I,i,j)$ and a weight vector and offset for each image location, $W^{i,j}$ and $W^{i,j}_0$.  So output pixel $O_{i,j} = {W^{i,j}}^T  R(I, i, j) + W^{i,j}_0$.\nThe parameters of a CNN trained on images of one size can often be applied successfully to images of another size. Is this true of PairNet?",
       "Solution": "Yes and no:\n\u2022 Yes: because the same weights are applied to every pair of inputs, that part of\nthe network is insensitive to the total number of inputs and can be applied to\nimages of different sizes.\n\u2022 No: the threshold at the last \u201dlayer\u201d might need to vary depending on the total\nnumber of outputs of the pair network being combined.\nPairNet only depends on pairs of pixels. Images of another size simply control the\nnumber of pairs and not the count of pairs.\n"
