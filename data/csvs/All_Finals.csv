- The filter is represented by a weight vector $w$ consisting of three values.
- The output of the network is a vector $\hat{y}$ whose $j^{t h}$ coordinate (pixel) is $\hat{y}_{j}=\sigma\left(z_{j}\right.$ ) where $z_{j}=\left[x_{j-1} ; x_{j} ; x_{j+1}\right]^{T} w$ and $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the sigmoid function.

Fall 2017,7,e,2,Reinforcement Learning,Text,"Chris wants to use Q-learning to solve a video-game problem in which there is a ball moving on an $\mathrm{n}$ by $\mathrm{n}$ pixel screen, similar to the one we studied in class. However, instead of moving a paddle up and down along the right wall, there is a """"photon cannon"""" fixed in the middle of the right-hand side, and the player is allowed to instantaneously set the angle of the cannon and to try to shoot. If the photon beam hits the ball, the ball will reflect backwards. It takes 10 time steps for the cannon to recharge after being fired, however, before it can be fired again. Our goal here is to try to understand how to apply deep Q-learning to this problem.
The state of the system is composed of five parts:
- Ball position x (1 .. n)
- Ball position y (1 ... n)
- Ball velocity x $(-1,1)$
- Ball velocity y $(-1,0,1)$
- Number of time steps until the cannon is ready to shoot again $(0, \ldots, 10)$
The possible actions at each time step involve both the aim and whether to try to shoot:
- Cannon angle in degrees $(-60,-30,0,30,60)$
- Shoot cannon $(1,0)$
The options for us in terms of solving the game include how we represent the states and actions and how these are mapped to Q-values. We won't worry about the exploration problem here, only about representing $Q$-values. Our learning algorithm performs gradient descent steps on the squared Bellman error with respect to the parameters in the $Q$-values.If we increase $n$ and also include many more angle gradations for the aim, so that $|S|$ and $|A|$ are very large, which of the following architectures would we prefer for repenting Q-values? Choose from: 
A. $|S|$ input units (one-hot vector for $s),
B. |A|$ output units, 5 input units, some $m$ hidden units, $|A|$ output units,
C. $5+2$ input units for the five part state, two-part action, $m$ hidden units and one output unit 
D. 5 input units, some $m$ hidden units, and two output units.","C. $5+2$ input units for the five part state, two-part action, $m$ hidden units and one output unit "

- The general shape of the curves.

The following images are the result of convolving the original image with these 4 simple filters and running through a ReLU. Black squares have value $+1$, grey squares have value $+0.5$, and the rest have value 0 .

It is slightly unusual to have $2 \times 2$ filters (usually they have odd dimension). When we apply them, we place the upper-left pixel of the filter on top of the image pixel whose value we are computing.

The next layer of Kanye's network now takes an input of depth 4 and applies a single $2 x$ $2 \times 4$ filter.

marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks sequentially in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. In this question, we'll consider a solitaire version of tic-tac-toe, in which we assume:
• We are the X player;
• The O player is a fixed (but possibly stochastic) algorithm;
• The initial state of the board is empty, and X has the first move;
• We can select any of the nine squares on our turn;
• We don't know the strategy of the O player or the reward function used by O.
We place an X in an empty square, then an O appears in some other square, and then it's our turn to play again. We receive a +1 reward for getting three X's in a row, reward -1 if there are three O's in a row, and reward 0 otherwise. If we select a square that already has an X or an O in it, nothing changes and it's still our turn.
We can model this problem as a Markov decision process in several different ways. Here are some possible choices for the state space.
• Jody suggests letting the state space be all possible 3 x 3 grids in which each square contains one of the following: a space, an O, and an X.
• Dana suggests using all possible 3 x 3 grids in which each square contains one of the three options (a space, an O, and an X), and there is an equal number of O's and X's.
• Chris suggests using all 3 x 3 tic-tac-toe game grids which appear in games where the players both employ optimal strategies.
Suppose you apply Q-learning to the 3x3 tic-tac-toe problem, and your actions always select an unfilled square. Bert suggests that it is okay to let the discount factor be 1. Is that true? Explain why or why not.",Yes. The game has a finite number of steps.

Conne decides to use the neural network code as written by a $6.036$ student for the $6.036$ homework (and that actually was a correct implementation) to train her CNN using SGD. The sgd procedure may be called multiple times from elsewhere (e.g., to implement multiple epochs of SGD). Conne thinks she has a better sgd python procedure than that given in the package; her code is:
def sgd (nn , X, Y, iters =100 , lrate =0.005) :
    D, N = X.shape
    sum loss = 0
    for k in range(iters) :
        Xt = X[ : , k : k+1]
        Yt = Y[ : , k : k+1]
        Ypred = nn.forward(Xt)
        sum_loss += nn.loss.forward(Ypred , Yt)
        err = nn.loss.backward()
        nn.backward(err)
        nn.sgd_step(lrate)
Here, $n n$ is an instance of the Sequential class implementing the CNN. She knows from the unit tests that the nn routines function properly. In particular, nn.forward properly computes the predicted outputs Ypred from input data Xt, nn.loss.forward also properly computes the forward loss, $\mathrm{nn}$.loss.backward properly computes the backward loss, nn. backward properly computes the backward gradients, and nn.sgd_step properly applies an SGD update step with the specified learning rate lrate. And the $N$ sets of dimension $D$ input data $X$, and labels $Y$ are known to be correct.
However, Conne's procedure consistently gives poor results (and occasionally throws errors), compared with the $6.036$ student's correct SGD routine, when run with identical arguments.
Why? Specify the line(s) which have errors, and describe how the code should be improved to do as well as the correct implementation of the $6.036$ student","Lines 5 and 6. The SGD algorithm needs a random data point to be selected for the gradient computation. Thus, the Xt and Yt assignments should draw from a randomly chosen $j$, e.g.
for k in range ( iters ) :
    j = np.random.randint(N)
    Xt = X[ : , j : j +1]
    Yt = Y[ : , j : j +1]

Bob continues using this update scheme whenever he adds new movies and users. Does the order in which Bob receives new information affect the final values of $U$ and $V$ that he learns? Explain.","Yes. Let us say Bob gets information about movie $k$ and person $a$ in that order. Based on this new update scheme, the row in $V$ corresponding to movie $k$ will be frozen after the information is received, and will not be updated when the information about person $a$ is received. On the other hand, the learned row in $U$ corresponding to person $a$ will depend in part on the previously updated row in $V$ corresponding to movie $k$.

If the information was received in the opposite order, we would have the opposite result. The row in $U$ corresponding to person $a$ would be frozen after the first piece of information was received, and not be influenced by the information about movie $k$. Meanwhile, the row in $V$ corresponding to movie $k$ would be learned in part based on the information gained about person a previously.

Thus, the order of new information matters a lot in this new scheme, because $U$ and $V$ aren't jointly optimized completely every time new information is received.

Would you expect that this method would make better predictions than if we just used Bob's original procedure? Explain.","Yes.

Whenever we retrain $U$ and $V$ from scratch, we are minimizing the objective function over all variables in the problem (all entries of $U$ and $V$ ) so the minimum of the objective will be lower than we could obtain by just retraining a subset of variables, as we were doing in the previous part to lower computational costs. Name:

Thus, this method will make better predictions"
Spring 2019,6,h,1.75,Classifiers,Text,"After taking 6.036, Bob decides to train a recommender system to predict what ratings different customers will give to different movies. Currently, he knows of three really popular movies, and he knows of two potential customers who have ranked some of these movies. The data matrix currently looks like: $Y=[[2, ?, 3],[4,2, ?]]$ where, as in class, rows correspond to customers and columns correspond to movies, and ? indicates a missing or unknown ranking. He decides to find a low rank factorization of $Y$ using the alternating least squares algorithm implemented in class. Assume for this question that offsets are set to $0.$
Bob is happy about what he has accomplished, until he realizes that there are a bunch of movies and users that he still needs to add to his database! He sees that his database will slowly grow over time, and that it will be time-consuming to train a completely new model every single time he updates his database. If Bob has an $m \times n$ data matrix which he wants to find a rank $k$ factorization for, his analysis indicates that the worst-case run-time (in terms of number of expensive multiplications) of performing alternating least squares for $t$ iterations (where each iteration updates both $U$ and $V)$ will be $O(k^{2}*m*n*t)$.
Instead, Bob comes upon the following idea: whenever he gets information about a new movie, he adds an extra row to $V$ but does not alter the existing entries of $U$ or $V$. He then finds the values of the entries in that extra row that minimize the objective function (with no regularization). He performs a similar procedure when he gets a new user, but instead adds an extra row to $U$. 
Bob modifies this procedure so that he still adds new movies and users in this way, but after every 100 new additions, he retrains $U$ and $V$ from scratch using alternating least squares.
After having added a few thousand users and movies to his database, Bob wants to try analyzing the user and movie vectors that he has learned, in order to see whether he can interpret what is causing customers to like certain movies over others. However, some of the numbers in $U$ and $V$ have a very high magnitude, which may lead to problems with numerical precision. How might Bob adjust his training process to fix the problem of high magnitude numbers in $U$ and $V$ ?
","In order to have fewer numbers of large magnitude, Bob can employ regularization of both $U, V$."

Method 1: Construct a training-sequence pair $(x, y)$ from an example $(e, m)$ by letting $x=(e_{1}, e_{2}, \ldots, e_{L}, stop)$, $y=\left(m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{L}, \text { stop }). In Method 1, we assume that if the original $e$ and $m$ had different numbers of words, then the shorter sentence is padded with enough time-wasting words (""ummm"" for English, ""grlork"" for Martian) so that they now have equal length, L. Any needed padding words are inserted at the end of $e^{(i)}$, and at the start of $m^{(i)}$.
Method 2: Construct a training-sequence pair $(x, y)$ from an example $(e, m)$ by letting $x=(e_{1}, e_{2}, \ldots, e_{J}, \text { stop, blank }, \ldots, \text { blank })$, $y=(\text { blank }, \ldots, \text { blank, } m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{K}, \text { stop })$. In Method 2 , blanks are inserted at the end of $e$ and start of $m$ such that the length of $x$ and $y$ are now both $J+K+1$.
Which method is better if English and Martian have very different word order? Explain why.","Method 2 since it can first parse the entire input sentence, and then output in a different word order."

Martian linguist Grlymp thinks it is also important to pad the original English and Martian sentences with time-wasting word to be of the same length for Method 2 (i.e., so that $J=K$, but English linguist Chome Nimsky disagrees. Who is correct, and why?","Chome Nimsky is right: Method 2 already has full flexibility in processing the entire sentence $e$ before outputting $m$, so additional time-wasting words would not help (and may hurt) in expressiveness and/or training."

What would you expect to see with your training and test accuracy, compared to just having one hidden layer with activation $f^{(1)}$ ?","The intermediary hidden layers do not add any expressivity to the network, and we would expect similar training and test accuracy as compared to the single $f^{(1)}$ hidden layer network.

Otto's other friend Leila says having more layers is better. Let $m$ be much smaller than d. Leila adds 10 more hidden layers all with linear activation before Neil suggests to have several layers with non-linear activation function. He says Otto should regularize the number of active hidden units. Loosely speaking, we consider the average activation of a hidden unit $j$ in our hidden layer 1 (which has sigmoid activation function $\left.f^{(1)}\right)$ to be the average of the activation of $a_{j}^{(1)}$ over the points $x_{i}$ in our training dataset of size $N$ :
$$
\hat{p}_{j}=\frac{1}{N} \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} a_{j}^{(1)}\left(x_{i}\right)
$$
Assume we would like to enforce the constraint that the average activation for each hidden unit $\hat{p}_{j}$ is close to some hyperparameter $p$. Usually, $p$ is very small (say $p<0.05$ ).
What is the best format for a regularization penalty given hyperparameter $p$ and the average activation for all our hidden units: $\hat{p}_{j}$ ? Select one of the following:
A. Hinge loss: $\Sigma_{j} \max \left(0,\left(1-\hat{p}_{j}\right) p\right)$
B. NLL: $\Sigma_{j}\left(-p \log \frac{p}{\hat{p}_{j}}-(1-p) \log \frac{(1-p)}{\left(1-\hat{p}_{j}\right)}\right)$
C. Squared loss: $\Sigma_{j}\left(\hat{p}_{j}-p\right)^{2}$
D. l2 norm: $\Sigma_{j}\left(\hat{p}_{j}\right)^{2}$  ","Either NLL or squared loss should work, encouraging $p$ and $\hat{p}_{j}$ to be close. NLL loss might better handle wide range in the magnitudes of $\hat{p}_{j}$."

Fall 2019,5,g,3,MDPs,Image,"Consider the following simple MDP: Positive Reward
First consider the case where the MDP has positive reward. In this scenario, there is only one action $($ next $)$; we name this decision policy $\pi_{A}$ with $\pi_{A}(s)=n e x t$ for all $s$. The reward is $R(s, n e x t)=0$ for all states $s$, except for state $s_{k}$ where reward is $R\left(s_{k}\right.$, next $)=10$. We always start at state $s_{1}$ and each arrow indicates a deterministic transition probability $p=1$. There is no transition out of the end state $E N D$, and 0 reward for any action from the end state.
Consider the MDP below with negative rewards for some $R(s, a)$ and positive rewards for others. Now there are two actions, next and stop. The solid arrows show the probabilities of state transitions under action next; the dashed arrows show the probability of state transitions under action stop. (If there is no dashed arrow from a state, that indicates a probability $p=0$ of transitioning out of that state under action stop.) The corresponding rewards $R\left(s_{i}, a\right)$ are also indicated on the figure below. Note that the rewards are $R\left(s_{i}, n e x t\right)=-1$ for all $s_{i}$, except for state $s_{4}$, where the reward is $R\left(s_{4}\right.$, next $)=10$. Finally, under action stop, we have reward $R\left(s_{1}\right.$, stop $)=r$ (some unknown value $r$ ), and $R(s, s t o p)=0$ for all other states. As before, we always start in state $s_{1}$. There is no transition out of the end state $E N D$, and zero reward for any action from the end state, i.e., $R(E N D$, next $)=R(E N D, g o)=0$. Assume discount factor $\gamma$ and infinite horizon.
We consider two possible policies: $\pi_{A}(s)=n e x t$ for all $s$, and $\pi_{B}(s)=s t o p$ for all $s$. Your goal is to maximize your reward. When you start at $s_{1}$, you have reward 0 before taking any actions. Determine what $r$ should be, so that it is best to run this MDP under policy $\pi_{B}$ rather than policy $\pi_{A}$. Give your answer as an expression for $r$ involving $p$ and $\gamma$.","Under policy $\pi_{A}$ :
$$
\begin{aligned}
&V_{\pi}\left(s_{4}\right)=10 \\
&V_{\pi}\left(s_{3}\right)=-1+p \gamma V_{\pi}\left(s_{4}\right)+(1-p) \gamma V_{\pi}(\text { end })=-1+p \gamma \cdot 10 \\
&V_{\pi}\left(s_{2}\right)=-1+p \gamma V_{\pi}\left(s_{3}\right)=-1-p \gamma+(p \gamma)^{2} \cdot 10 \\
&V_{\pi}\left(s_{1}\right)=-1+p \gamma V_{\pi}\left(s_{2}\right)=-1-p \gamma-(p \gamma)^{2}+(p \gamma)^{3} \cdot 10

$$
Under policy $\pi_{B}$, we simply have $V_{\pi}\left(s_{1}\right)=r$. So we should choose policy $\pi_{B}$ when
$$

He wants the output of the tree for any input $\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)$ to be the probability that the input is a positive $(+1)$ example.
Recall that the weighted average entropy $\bar{H}$ of a split into subsets $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ is
$$
\bar{H}(\text { split })=\left(\text { fraction of points in } R_{1}\right) \cdot H\left(R_{1}\right)+\left(\text { fraction of points in } R_{2}\right) \cdot H\left(R_{2}\right)

Considering the entire data set, Paul finds that the best first split of these three is Split A, with $\bar{H}(A)=0.54$, compared to $\bar{H}(B)=0.92$ and $\bar{H}(C)=0.81$, resulting in a region $R_{A^{+}}$ with all positive examples, and a region $R_{A^{-}}$with mixed positive and negative examples. Given Split A, however, Paul is not sure which is the next split to include in his tree. Calculate the weighted average entropy of Split $\mathrm{B}$ for region $R_{A^{-}}, \bar{H}\left(B \mid R_{A^{-}}\right)$, versus Split $\mathrm{C}$ for the same region, $\bar{H}\left(C \mid R_{A^{-}}\right)$, and identify which of Split B or Split $\mathrm{C}$ Paul should choose for his second split.

Paul decides to consider a particular type of ""random forest,"" which is an ensemble or collection of decision trees, where each tree might only have a subset of split features. Paul restricts his trees to only use Splits A, B, C, or some combination of these splits. The final output of the random forest is the average of the output across the collection of $n$ trees (i.e., with equal weight $1 / n$ for each tree in the random forest). Paul's random forest consists of three trees:
- The tree consisting of the best single split using feature $x_{2}$ only.
- The tree consisting of the best single split using feature $x_{1}$ only.
- The tree consisting of the best two splits (in total) using both features $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ (this is the tree from part (a) in this problem).
For this random forest, what is the output for the probability that an input point at $(-1,1)$ is a positive $(+1)$ example? Note: Paul's calculations in part (a) may be of help.","The first tree corresponds to just Split A on $x_{2}$ from Paul's original tree; this tree gives $p=1.0$ for the point being a positive example. As noted in part (a) the best tree splitting only on $x_{1}$ is Split $\mathrm{C}$, since $\bar{H}(C)=0.81$ is less than $\bar{H}(B)=0.92)$;this tree has $p=0.0$ for the point $(-1,1)$ being a positive example. Finally, the two-split tree as derived in part (a) had $p=1.0$. Thus the aggregate (average) probability is that $(-1,1)$ is a positive example is $p=2 / 3$."

Would you expect the accuracy for Paul's random forest generated decision to be better, or for the decision made by Paul's single two-split decision tree from part (a) to be better, when evaluated against held-out test data? Explain.","We would expect that the random forest generated decision will generalize better. Using all the features available to us can lead to over-fitting. For random forests, although each individual decision tree can have a higher error rate on the training data, the averaging effect (or majority vote for classification trees) can serve as a filter on noise vs. true signal."

Suppose also that $\theta_{1}>\theta_{2}$ and both are positive $\left(\theta_{1}, \theta_{2}>0\right)$. We are interested in the behavior of $R_{\alpha}(\theta)$ and $R_{\lambda}(\theta)$. Assume both $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ are positive. Rega Lizer is interested in the behavior of these two regularizers, when used to fit a linear model by minimizing $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$. We compare the ridge regularizer $R_{\lambda}$ and the lasso regularizer $R_{\alpha}$, for general $k$. Assume $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are positive.

Define the local 3 x 3 region of the (zero-padded) input image $I$ around pixel $i, j$:
    \begin{align*}
    R(I,i,j) = (&I_{i-1, j-1}, I_{i-1, j}, I_{i-1, j+1}, \\
                 &I_{i, j-1}, I_{i, j}, I_{i, j+1}, \\
                 &I_{i+1, j-1}, I_{i+1, j}, I_{i+1, j+1})
    \end{align*}
where $I_{i,j}$ is the pixel $i, j$ of $I$.
Pixel $i,j$ of the output image is computed as the dot product of $R(I,i,j)$ and a weight vector and offset for each image location, $W^{i,j}$ and $W^{i,j}_0$.  So output pixel $O_{i,j} = {W^{i,j}}^T  R(I, i, j) + W^{i,j}_0$.. CNNs are often described as exploiting spatial locality and translation invariance. Does Hairnet explot spatial locality, translation invariance, both or neither?",Spatial locality
Spring 2021,6,e,1,CNNs,Text,"PairNet definition: The PairNet is parameterized by (a) the weights $W$ of a small network $\textrm{NN}$ and (b) one more scalar $w_0$. If there are a total of $d$ features in the input, it has the final form of:
\[y = \sigma(w_0 + \sum_{j \in \{1, \ldots, d\}, k \in \{1, \ldots, d\}, j \neq k} \textrm{NN}([x_j, x_k]; W))\]
The small neural network, parameterized by weights $W$, takes a two-dimensional vector as input and generates a scalar output.   We write it as $\text{NN}([x_i, x_j]; W)$.   If this smaller neural network has multiple layers, then $W$ includes all the weights of all the layers, including offsets.

The parameters of a CNN trained on images of one size can often be applied successfully to images of another size. Is this true of PairNet?","Yes and no:
• Yes: because the same weights are applied to every pair of inputs, that part of
the network is insensitive to the total number of inputs and can be applied to
images of different sizes.
• No: the threshold at the last ”layer” might need to vary depending on the total
number of outputs of the pair network being combined.
PairNet only depends on pairs of pixels. Images of another size simply control the
number of pairs and not the count of pairs.

How does a weighted nearest neighbor approach compare to linear regression for the same data? Why might we prefer one over the other?
","A linear regression model would fit a straight line through the training data and allow extrapolation. It would predict h(10) to be much larger because that is the trend in the training data (y is becoming larger as x is becoming large).
The Heavy Neighbor approach will keep the predictions within the limits of the training data labels (it is a weighted average of the training data points). This would be preferred if we do not want to extrapolate beyond the training data."
