# A Dataset and Benchmark for Automatically Answering and Generating Machine Learning Final Exams
Data and code for the paper ["A Dataset and Benchmark for Automatically Answering and Generating Machine Learning Final Exams" by Zhang et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05442). 

We present a new dataset of 496 questions from the eight most recent final exams of MITâ€™s Introduction to Machine Learning course. The dataset spans questions on the 12 machine learning topics covered in the course: (1) regression, (2) classifiers, (3) logistic regression, (4) features, (5) loss functions, (6) neural networks, (7) convolutional neural networks (CNNs), (8) Markov decision processes (MDPs), (9) recurrent neural networks (RNNs), (10) reinforcement learning, (11) clustering, and (12) decision trees. Summary statistics and details are available in Tables 3 and 4 in the paper.

We provide code for running zero- and few-shot learning and for generating new questions as described in the paper.
